# Dune_WallStress
 
 This repository will be where dune wall shear-stress data is held.

The data will be presented in CSV file format, with files formatted as: 
    tau_wall (either instantaneous, avg, or rms) | x-coordinates | y-coordinates | z-coordinates

Here, the x-, y-, and z-coordinates correspond to streamwise, spanwise, and wall-normal, respectively.
